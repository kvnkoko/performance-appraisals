# IMPORTANT: Run the Complete SQL Script First!

Before the app will work with Supabase for all data, you MUST run the complete SQL script:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Open `supabase-setup-complete.sql`
3. Copy ALL the SQL
4. Paste and Run it

This creates all the tables needed for templates, employees, appraisals, links, settings, and review periods.

After running the SQL, all your data will sync across all devices! 🎉
